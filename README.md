# steamos-java
Make Java usable in SteamOS by aliasing "java" to the path of a Java executable.

Intended use with the official Minecraft Launcher (available via Flathub) but should work with anything else that uses Java.

Java has to be running for this script to find it. In the case of Minecraft, have it open at the menu (not just the launcher).

The script will need root permissions to find the running Java executable, so you'll need a root password set.
